# Frogger 2D Replica

Learning Unity, creating a Frogger replica, roughly following along with Brackey's [live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZt6qDDx-2o)
and [github repo](https://github.com/Brackeys/Frogger-Replica).

# TODO

- ~~Prevent player from moving out of the play area~~
- ~~Have cars destroy themselves - either after a certain number of seconds, or when off-screen~~
- Use different car sprites (need transparent background)
- Animate the frog
- Add key to restart the game
- Give the player 3 frogs
- Add game over screen
- Add logs that you have to jump on, with water that is a lose condition
- Add variety to the levels
- Keep a high score, ideally persisting it
- ~~Add sound effects~~
- Add music
- Switch to new UI system
